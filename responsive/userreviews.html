            <p>"After watching this insane movie in the theatres back in 2014 I swore to god I will wait 5 years to
                 watch it again so I get to forget it and experince the insanity it has again. This without doubt is 
                 THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE"</p>

            <p>"Sometimes I just need to see the start. Or end. Or a trailer. Or the music and theme from Hans Zimmer. 
                Or the whole movie. Just to feel that thing, I only get from this movie. That the earth, space and time 
                are something special, mystical. I never forget the first time I saw this movie, in an IMAX theatre 
                in 2014. I was struck by it. Totally got me. And it stil does, 7 years later. This is the best movie ever 
                made for me. Because of the feeling it gives me, no other movie can. So hard to get all of this emotion in 
                only one movie. Brilliant."</p>

            <p>"Amongst the best movies of all time. The story, the acting, the script, the cinematography, the effects, 
                the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 10/10's.But what beats all of that is Hans Zimmers 
                compositions. How he continues to churn out perfection to the senses is mindblowing"</p>

                <h3>1. Written by: Akhil Arora</h3>
            <p>"Humbling and epic in scope, designed and conceptualised brilliantly, but a tad too stand-off-ish emotionally.
                 While the father-daughter dynamic works in parts, the Cooperâ€“Brand relationship is never given the right 
                 treatment and collapses."</p>

                <h3>2. Written by: Sean Axmaker</h3>
            <p>"This is a film where complex concepts of quantum physics and powerful human emotions are inextricably 
                intertwined and the ghost that haunts the farmhouse has both a scientific explanation and a sense of 
                supernatural power."</p>

                <h3>3. Written by: Don Shanahan</h3>
            <p>""Interstellar" pushes the limits for personal interpretation of both science and fiction. Both elements are 
                wildly heightened to a bold scale to address the internal opposites between logic and spectacle, science 
                and sentiment, and brains and emotion."</p>
