                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Cheddar cheese is a natural cheese that is relatively hard and can be off-white or orange in color, 
                depending on whether colorings such as annatto are added. It has its origins in the village of Cheddar 
                in Somerset, England, and is known for its sharp taste. The production of cheddar cheese has spread globally,
                 with no Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status, allowing various regions to produce their own versions</p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The history of cheddar cheese dates back to the 12th century in Somerset. It gained popularity due to its 
                long shelf life and portability, making it an ideal food for travelers and soldiers. In the 19th century,
                 Joseph Harding modernized cheddar production through scientific methods and innovations in dairy hygiene. 
                 His contributions helped standardize the process and expand cheddar’s reach to places like Scotland, North 
                 America, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>

                    <h3>Production Process</h3>
            <p>Cheddar cheese is made from cow’s milk through a process that involves separating curds from whey using rennet.
                 A unique step called “cheddaring” involves kneading the curd with salt and stacking it to drain whey. The 
                 aging process varies; strong or extra-mature cheddar requires maturing for 15 months or more. The ideal 
                 environment for maturing cheddar includes caves that provide consistent temperature and humidity.</p>
