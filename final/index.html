            <p>"Cheese is a dairy product derived from milk, and it has been a staple in many cultures around the world 
                for thousands of years. The process of cheese-making involves coagulating milk to separate curds (solid) 
                from whey (liquid), followed by various methods of aging and flavoring. There are numerous types of cheese, 
                each with unique flavors, textures, and uses. In this overview, we will focus on four popular varieties: Swiss,
                 cheddar, mozzarella, and American cheese.</p>
