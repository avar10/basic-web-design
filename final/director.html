                 the arrival of a cunning cat burglar (Anne Hathaway) and a merciless terrorist named Bane (Tom Hardy) force 
                 Batman out of exile and into a battle he may not be able to win.</li>

                offered a seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in someone's mind. If he succeeds, it will be the perfect 
                crime, but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobb's every move.</li>
